# Book-Recommender-System

Context

The primary reason for creating this dataset is the requirement of a good clean dataset of books.
I had previously searched for datasets on books in kaggle itself - and I found out that while 
most of the datasets had a good amount of books listed, there
were either a) major columns missing or b) unclean data. I mean, you can't determine
how good a book is just from a few text reviews. What I needed were numbers, solid
integers and floats that say how many people liked the book or hated it, how much did they like it,
and stuff like that. Even the good dataset that I found was well-cleaned, it had a number of
interlinked files, which increased the hassle. This prompted me to use the Goodreads API to get
a well-cleaned dataset, with the promising features and the
result is the dataset you're at now.
